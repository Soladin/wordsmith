WordSmith
=========

Hello, there. WordSmith is a web app being designed to help you study. With one click, it generates a collection--or WordSet--of terms from a webpage that you designate. From there, you can edit the terms and add their definitions.

Future updates will include log-in support and private WordSets for each user, functionality for printing wordsets, and support for automatically generating definitions for WordSets created from specific websites (ie, Wikipedia).
